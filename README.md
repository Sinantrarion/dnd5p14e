# This does not work. Sadly many of the values in DnD5e are built very early on, and this just breaks. Instead, the actual implementation has been moved to a fork of dnd5e to here https://github.com/Sinantrarion/dnd5d14e

# dnd-5.14e
This is the main module which brings the implementations of the homebrew project DnD 5.14e into Foundry 5e.
